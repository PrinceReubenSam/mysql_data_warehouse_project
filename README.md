## Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** that integrates sales data from multiple sources and enables analytics for informed business decision-making.

##  Data Engineering – Building the Warehouse

**Key Components:**

- **Data Sources:**  
  Imported datasets from two CSV-based systems: **ERP** and **CRM**.

  Identified and resolved data quality issues to ensure reliable analysis.

- **Data Integration:**  
  Merged both sources into a single, analytical schema optimized for querying.
